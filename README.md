The Pig Game is a simple yet engaging dice game often implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Here's a concise description:

Objective: The goal is to be the first player to reach a target score, typically 100 points.
Gameplay:
Two players take turns rolling a die.
On each turn, a player can roll the die repeatedly to accumulate points for that turn.
If the player rolls a 1, they lose all points for that turn, and their turn ends.
A player can choose to "hold" at any time, adding the accumulated points to their total score and passing the turn to the other player.
Winning: The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.

This game is a great project for learning JavaScript, as it involves concepts like event handling, DOM manipulation, and game logic implementation. It also allows for creative UI/UX design to enhance the user experience.
